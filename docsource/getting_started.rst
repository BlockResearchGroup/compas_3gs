Rhino
=====

:mod:`compas_3gs` is developed independent of the functionality of CAD software.
However, CAD software is still necessary in a computational design environment for visualising and interacting with datastructures and geometrical objects.
For the examples presented in this documentation, `Rhinoceros <https://www.rhino3d.com/>`_ is chosen as the CAD software for user interaction and visualisation of script results.
For a more detailed information on how to install COMPAS and its packages for Rhino, please refer to `Working in Rhino <https://compas-dev.github.io/main/renvironments/rhino.html>`_ page of the COMPAS documentation.
