Constructor
********************************************************************************

A single polyhedral cell can be constructed from a set of equilibrated force vectors.
In some cases, it may be convenient to use Rhino polysurfaces to build the ``volmesh`` representing a multi-cell polyhedron.
It is possible for a ``volmesh`` to have just one cell.
